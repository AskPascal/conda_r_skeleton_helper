# Conda r skeleton helpers (for conda-forge)

Some hacks to create conda-forge r-recipes.
Just put the package name(s) in `packages.txt` in the form of `r-foobar` and run the `./run.sh` script. You will end up with a bunch of `r-*` folders. Please check them manually.
Especially the LICENSE section - this sections should not contain the word license.
